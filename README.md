# **Pok√©mon MVP Tournament**

</div>

_August 2025, My coded universe_ :sparkles:

### **About the project** :trophy:

Pok√©mon MVP Tournament (or PMT for friends) is an Android application in development which simulates a fictional competitive tournament. It was born as a personal project driven by creativity, expression, and a passion for entertainment, where I combine my learning about Multiplatform Applications Development with a simulated tournament: _Pok√©mon_ is the content, , _RuPaul's Drag Race_ gave me the form and _this app_ is the medium.

### **About the app** :iphone:

The PMT app pretends to keep the users up to date about the tournament news, and make them take part in the decision makings about the future of this universe:

### **Next steps** :paw_prints:

Although the app is in development, take a look at the checklist to know which are the next steps:

##### _Frontend: visible functionalities_
- [ ] Login validation and Register new user screen
- [ ] First season information screen
- [ ] User screen with user personal data and access to tournament polls

##### _Backend: API and persistence_

### **Inspiration and Motivation** :sparkles:

***

As a highly creative person, I find in entertainment my main way of expression, individual and artistically, and in competition a stage for showing my abilities.
That is why this project allows me to combine the logic in the software development with the emotion of the competitive tournaments, with the goal that users not only see the data, but also live the full experience of a competitive reality show.
